# Simulations-and-modelling-physics SI1336
The course introduces computer simulation as a general and elegant problem-solving approach in engineering sciences, which can be used where traditional methods do not work. The course aims to provide skills to use the computer as a powerful tool for the simulation - computer experiments - studying physical and general interacting systems. The course covers both modeling and computing as parts of the same whole. How should the model be formulated to be both realistic and possible to simulate efficiently? How should the simulation performed to identify the characteristics of the system and provide results that can be compared with the ruckus?
The course includes introductory lectures introducing various concepts, skills and models. The main part of the course consists of a number of student projects. The projects include modeling and programming problems from different areas of physics and engineering, such as classical mechanics, electromagnetism, statistical mechanics, forest fires and traffic. For each project used all the steps you need for simulations in academia and industry: introduce a problem area, formulating a model, choose one or more simulation methods, write or adapt a program, running simulations and analyzing and presenting the results.
The course provides a flexible set of modeling and simulation skills that can be used to study many other problems.
